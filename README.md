Muslim Prayer Timetable Extension
=================================

This is a Google Chrome extension that shows the prayer times for Muslims. 
It uses HTML5 geolocation features that grabs the current latitude and longitute 
and fetches the prayer times.

This extension is developed by [Mohamed Mansour](http://mohamedmansour.com) but 
the prayer time calculations are based off the brother
[Dr. Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh](http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~zarrabi/home) A list of
contributions are listed in the [AUTHORS file](https://github.com/mohamedmansour/prayer-times-extension/raw/master/AUTHORS.md)

There are differing opinions on what angle to use to calculate Fajr and Isha. It
currently supports 6 different calculations.

**Leva Research Institute (L.R.I.) is a religious research center established in 1993 in Qom, Iran
For example, according to L.R.I's convention, Fajr = Dhuhr - T(16), and Isha = Dhuhr + T(14).*
